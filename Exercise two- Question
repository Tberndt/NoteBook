How does reading this material in this way change/challenge/or focus your understanding of the material?

I think the intention of having this material layed out this way, is intended to make the information easier to read. However with my lack of 
computer and tech skills it makes it more challenging for me ahahah. I guess in a way it organizes and simplifies the material, im just 
unsure how to navigate it
