 Exercise 1: Regular Extensions 

-Tried opening RegeXr, have never used before and looks very complicated
- curlhttp://archive.org/stream/diplomaticcorre33statgoog/diplomaticcorre33statgoog_djvu.txt > texas.txt
used this in the command line downloaded good, used nano to make sure its there
-	deleted the un needed parts in the text
-	took the fine and opened it in sublime text 
in sublime text
•	copied the names in the text and up loaded to DH box 
•	re opened the text file from step one that I edited in Sublime text 
•	grep '\bto\b' texas.txt – this is used all the “to” in the text, every line is edited with the line to in it with this command we give 
•	copied and pasted the work from sublime text, little difficulty using this program
•	confused with step 3???
Placed in the equation $ sed -r -i.bak 's/(.+\bto\b.+)/~\1/g' texas.txt
•	this put a ~ in front of every line of text 
•	used nano to view text 
•	its worked!!!!
Step two 
•	trying to find all the lines that have ~ in the text that I just imput 
I impute    $ grep '~' texas.txt > index.txt
•	And use nano to make sure its their 
•	No issues very straight forward
Step 3
•	Now trying to remove the ~
I use the DH box and put in command sed -r -i.bak 's/(,)( [0-9]{4})(.+)/\2/g' index.txt
•	Error, 
•	Opsie I put the slash the wrong way, I re impute and uses nano to view it 
•	The text comes up with the ~???
•	Ohhh, this step isent to remove the ~, my text is okay 
Step 4 
•	Now I am removing ~
In Dh box I write in command sed -r -i.bak 's/~//g' index.txt
•	Error, I re do command 
•	I accidently placed a space, I use nano to view the text 
•	The ~ are gone!!!
Step 5
•	In DH box I write  $ sed -r -i.bak 's/(\b to \b)/,/g' index.txt
•	I use nano to view the format of text 
•	It looks okay, 
Step 6 
I put the file I just made in Regex, and place in .+,.+,.+,
•	I use this equation to eliminate all the extra commas ( I only want 2)
•	The ones that have more then two are highlighted blue. 
I uses cp index.txt cleaned-correspondence.csv when I am finished taking out the commas to save my work 
- open my file I just made and its not formatted correctly, sender and receiver are in the same column and the dates are in the sender and date column 
•	I must go back and re do step 5?
•	I found my error!!! The command in step 5 was incorrect, I re do setep 6 in Regex, I think my file came out ok!!
