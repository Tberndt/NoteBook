Exercise 4 

APIs- Application Programming Interface, using the Canadian Discovery Portal

&fmt=json - add at the end of URL so data is better formatted for us to work with

sudo apt-get install jq -y - jp previously installed in last exercise, put into command line

mkdir m2e4 and cd m2e4 -used to make a new directory

pwd followed by touch canadiana.sh - this is used to make a new file for the program ( touch ) is making an empty file and sh is used to  indicate the file name

the new file opened and i copy and pasted the large text paragraph that was in the workbook, in this text i shorted the search to a narrower time frame

chmod 755 canadiana.sh - is used to let our DH box know that this is a ok program./canadiana.sh, this allows us to run the actual program

-> i now have created a new file, and have successfully opened my new file made, i have taken data from Canadian Discovery Portal
