mod-5 Mining Twitter

set up twitter was easy

- i was able to follow steps 1-10 with no problems, however the first step that i needed the command line for was to impute: sudo pip install https://github.com/DocNow/twarc/archive/v1.2.0.tar.gz 
in the command like and keeps coming up with a error

" command not found"- im not sure why this is happening, 
i tried to do Sudo update to see if this would help, but after when i put in the same command i still got the same error 
:(, i will leave this one for now and try to work on it at a later time
