Exercise 6 - using Tesseract to turn an image into text

- to start at converting images i put mkdir ocr-test in command line, to make a new directory, successfully done 

- cd ocr-test- this command worked good to and i am able to continue onto the next step 

-sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr- asked for my password and downloaded well 

sudo apt-get install imagemagick - error????

convert -density 300 ~/war-diary/e001518087.jpg -depth 8 -strip -background white -alpha off e001518087.tiff

- imputing this in came back with a error saying that it did not exist 

- i re did steps 1-5, 3 times to make sure i impute everything in right

- i read the zulip and others seemed to have this problem, i then went back to Exercise 2 to make sure that i completed it properly 

- i re did Exercise 2 a few times, but was still having this trouble 

- i keep getting this same error and  followed tips from classmates but cannot seem to figure out what time doing wrong
